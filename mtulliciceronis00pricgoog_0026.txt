Ate. 1, 3, 10, when speaking of the περὶ Φιλίας of The·

legisse, eum ipse quoque librum de amicilia componeret,
Both Seneca and Plutarch give the passage from Theo
phrastus, which Cicero translates literally in ξ 85. The
parallel passages are: οὐ φιλοῦντα δεῖ κρίνειν ἀλλὰ κρίναντα

by using archaic forms and expressions Attention is called
to these in the explanatory notes, and also 'to the introduc·
tion of certain oratorical turns showing that Cicero could
not entirely conceal his own profession. He has aimed
to give the essay or dialogue a highly colloquial effect by
means of anacoluthon, pleonasm, and repetition; yet with
this we must compare the studied eflects in certain other
