at Scipio's death, but I am comforted with the thought that
aiter a brilliant career he has attained immortality. I

Fannius. Now that you have mentioned friendship, we

Laelius. lam unable to give you a philosophica] dis-
cussion of the subject as the Greek philosophers might,
but I will do the best Ι can to help you to realize that
friendship deserves the highest consideration. It can
exist only between the good. This term has its ordinary
signification, not that given to it by the philosophers.
Friendship is stronger than relationship. It consists of
oneness of purpose, is based on virtue, andis our choicest
earthly possession. It entiches our blessings and lessens
our troubles. The loss of it would wreck the world. Its
power is everywhere recognized.

vantages sought, but in affection, the highest form oi

create, friendship, and the philosophers who ascribe friend-
ship to the desire for reward or pleasure are wrong.
Friendships tend to be broken by party lines in politics,
marriage arrangements‚ preferment in office, greed ior
gain, and by the request of a friend ior an improper service.

36-44. How far should one go in aiding a friend?
Warning examples of men who have made dishonorable

requests are introduced. These difficulties would not arise
