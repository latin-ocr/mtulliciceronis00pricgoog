Scaevola, pontifex, was consul in 95 ac, aud was killed ΒΥ

a partisan of Sulla.

(c) Fannius. Gaius Fannius Strabo, also a son-inlaw
of Laelius, was a soldier, statesman, and writer. He was
among the first to enter 'Carthage when it was captured by
Scipio in 146 nc, and later served in Spain under Fabius
in the war against Viriathus He attained the consulship
in 122 rac. He wrote of the wars in which he participated

was the younger son of Lucius Aemilius Paulus. Upon
his adoption by P. Cornelius Scipio, the son of the con-
queror of Hannibal, he retained the name Aemilianus to
designate his descent. He was born about 185 ae, and

first gained distinction while fighting at Pydna under his
father in 168 ne. In his earlier years his fondness for
literary pursuits caused the Scipios to fear that he would
not uphold their reputation as a military family; but he
volunteered for service in Spain in 151 nc, when that ser-

Scipio’s ability were sent to Rome by the soldiers then ins
Africa, that Scipio was elected consul in 147 nc, though

he had not attained the legal age. His siege and capture
