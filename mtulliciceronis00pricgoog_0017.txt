INTRODUCPION

Cicero dedicated and sent the Laelius to his friend, Titus
⁴ Pomponius Atticus. Atticus (so called from his long resi-
‹dence in Athens)was three years older than Cicero. They
¹were educated together and maintained the most intimate
relations until Cicero’s death ; in fact, Cicero wished Atticus
to see in the friendship of Scipio and Laelius a reminder of
their own friendship. Atticus belonged to the equestrian
order and the Marian party, but chose business rather than

politics as a profession. After the proscriptions of Sulla

he withdrew in 85 ne. to Athens, ostensibly to study, but
really for safety. While there he devoted himself to the
study of Greek philosophy and literature and to the increas-
ing of the great wealth he had inherited from his father
and uncle. He followed Epicurus in philosophy and was
thoroughly acquainted with the whole range of Greek and

. Latin literature. His opinions were greatly respected, and

many literary men submitted their productioris to him for
criticism; this may have been in Cicero’s mind a secondary
motive for sending the Cato Maior and the Laelius to Atti·
cus. He did a private banking business and invested large
sums in the corporations which farmed the revenues. It
is probable that many of Cicero’s books were given to the
public through Atticus as his publisher‚ for he kept a large
number of slaves at his house, whom he employed in copy-
ing books, both for his own library and for sale. 11165 ue.
he left Athens to take up again his residence in Rome.
His departure was the cause of general regret at Athens.
Because of his rank, wealth, culture, and lack of party feel-

ing, he lived on intimate terms with the distinguished men
of all parties, including Sulla, Caesar, Pompey, Brutus, An-
tony, Octavius, and others The correspondence of Cicero
(Epistulae ad Attz'cum), covering a period of twenty-five
yearS, has come down to us, and proves the sincerity of the

friendship of Cicero and Atticus. Atticus died in 32 nc.
