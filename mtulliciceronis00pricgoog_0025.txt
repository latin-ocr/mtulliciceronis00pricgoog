INTRODUCTION

of Cicero’s essay on friendship, Schools of philosophy, as
well as individuals, had their theories on this interesting
theme.

Empedocles (about 450 ae), in trying to improve upon
the philosophical system of the Pythagoream, who held
that number (perfect equality) was the power which united
and kept all things in systematic order, hit upon the theory

, that love unites and hate separates. Heraclitus before

· him had held that unlikeness is the uniting force, a'.e. that
“the unlike poles attract.” Socrates exalted friendship,
and his follower Plato tried to harmonize the theory of
the Pythagoreans and that of Heraclitus, but confused love
and friendship (Ernst Curtius, Der Freaadscleastsdegriff
derAltea). ’

Xenophon (Memorabilia, 2, 4-10) lays down certain
principles which Cicero mentions in the Laelius, eg. no
friendship without virtue ; it is the best of our blessings, etc.
Unquestionably Cicero had read this treatise, and certain
phrases having clung in his memory, came to him uncon-
sciously when he began to write about friendship. He
was certainly familiar with Xenophon’s writings, and had
quoted him at length in the Cata Maiae only a few weeks
previous to the writing of the Laelius. ’

We cannot be sure that Cicero read Plato at the time he
composed the Laelius, though he paraphrases him at length
in the Cata Maior. Cicero does present, however, several
sentiments which correspond to the views of Plato: ag.
in §3 he is following closely the introduction of the
Theaetetus. Neither can we be certain that Cicero read
Aristotle or used his works in connection with the com-
position of this essay, though Reid and others have pointed
out certain ideas which the Laelius and the Maamacaaaa
Etleies have in common.
