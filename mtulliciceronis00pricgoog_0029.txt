1-5. Cicero tells Atticus how their patron Scaevola
happened to mention a quarrel between two men who had
been close friends. This suggested to Scaevola a conver-
sation about friendship which Laelius had with his two
sons-in-law, Scaevola and Fannius. Cicero renders this con-
versation freely in accordance with the request of Atticus
that he write something about friendship. As Cato seemed
best suited to speak of old age in the Cato Maior, so Lae-

suited to speak on friendship. Cicero suggests to Atticus
tbat the whole speech of Laelius is but a reminder oi their
own friendship.

. as a Stoic should. Scaevola. Itold them that considera-
