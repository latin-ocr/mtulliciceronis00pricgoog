INTRODUCPION

around Scipio a company of distinguished scholars and
literary men who read and discussed in Greek the poetry
and philosophy oi Greece. This company, called the
Scipionic circle, included Laelius, Philus, Manlius, Ter-
ence, Pacuvius, and Mummius allos whom are mentioned
in the Laelius, besides such men as Polybius, the historian,
Lucilius, the satirist, and Panaetius, the philosopher. Cor-
rectness of style was the aim oi the men who composed
the Scipionic circle. Terence, in the prologues of his
playS, promises “pure Latin,’' a veiled thrust at the Latin-
inity oi previous writers, and Lucilius criticises severely
the style of Ennius, Plautus, etc. The influence of this
literary club can hardly be overestimated. These men,
separating themselves from the common people, developed
a style of Latin eminently pure, which reached its highest
perlection in the hands oi Cicero. Side by side with it
lived the language of the common people (sermo cotidi-
anus), which, having more vigor because it was less arti-
ficial, survived the Latin of the Ciceronian age, and still
exists in the Romance languages, French, Italian, Spanish‚
etc. Scipio and Laelius had come under the influence

of Greek philosophers as early as 155 B.c., when a new .

incentive to the study of philosophy was received at Rome.
Of the three systems introduced at that time, —Academie
Stoic, and Peripatetic, ·-the greatest influence was exerted
by the Stoics. Panaetius oi the Scipionic circle was a
teacher of Stoicism, and many passages in the Laelius
contain references to that system oi philosophy. The

study of Greek philosophy, while unpopular for a time, ¹

soon gained great headway at Rome. The Roman youth,
having tested the soundness of the Greek thought, could
not be satisfied with anything inferior.
