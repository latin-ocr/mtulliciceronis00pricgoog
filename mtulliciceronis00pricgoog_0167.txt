Cicero's defense of old age is so charming in style and
so interesting in matter that it deserves something more
by way of commentary than mere discussion of gram-
matical and linguistic usage. Accordingly an attempt has
been made in the illustrative notes, on the pages with
the text, to give prominence to the historical and
literary features of the essay, and to show by numerous
quotations what ancient and modern authors have uttered
like thoughtS, couched in similar forms of expression.

In order that the chief emphasis may be placed on the
literary element, the grammatical and textual commentary
is placed in a separate body of notes following the text.
The commentarios are supplemented bya list of variations
from the text of Muller, an index to the notes and an
index of proper names.

The text is preceded by an introduction containing a
life of Cic'er0, a resume of his work5,a valuable bibli-
ography, and a discussion, analysis, and summary of the

De Senectute.

Cepies of Cicero's Cato Maior De Senectute will be sent, prepaid, to any
