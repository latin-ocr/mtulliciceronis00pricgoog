petraturum non fuisse? cum illi sanctissimi viri fuerint-,1
roaeque autem nefas sit tale aliquid et iacere rogatum
et rogare. At vero Ti. Gracchum sequebantur C. Carb0,
C. Catu, et minime tum quidem C. frater, nunc idem acer-

rimus,

contendisset. . . fuisse: in the
direct discourse the condition is
contrary to reality in past time,

in both clauses. As subject and
object, supply quisquam and quip-

able.'- ιο. rogatum: = crcnrroga-
tus rit. - 11. At: denotes the
sharpest kind of contrast, and is

osten used when a new subject, or
anew phase of the subject under
discussion, is introduced. The

here mentioned is not true friend-

Carbo, an able, but wholly unprin-

cipled man, was one of the three
commissioners to put into effect
the agrarian law of Ti. Gracchus.
Astribune of the plebs in 13113.c.,
he violently opposed the aristoc-

death of C. Gracchus he suddenly
deserted the plebeian party, and
as consul in 120 Bc. undertook
the defense of OpimiuS, who had
murdered C. Gracchus. When
brought to trial in 119 Bc, on the
charge of participating in the re-

grandson of Cato the Censor and
of Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus.
ln his youth he was a follower of
Ti. Gracchus, and attained the
consulship in 114u.c. He mis·

...nuncz Gaius was at most
twenty-six years old at the time
of his brother's death, and accord-
ing to Plutarch only twenty or
twenty-one. His youth accounts
for his inactiuity at that time.
