INTRODUCPION

the Romans came into contact with a new civilization.
The discipline of the soldiers relaxed as they acquired the
habits of the Orient, and the introduction oi eastern ex-
travagance and vice into Rome stirred to action the men
oi simpler habits, led by Cato the Censor. They protested
vigorously against everything Greek, even denying a resi·
dence at Rome to the Greek philosophers who came ona ’
diplomatic errand in 155 B.c., because they presumed to
give lectures on philosophy to the Roman youth. Any
one who showed acquaintance with the philosophy or
even the language of the Greeks, gained the ill-will of
the majority of his countrymen. This is shown in the
Laelius in many places. cicero, fully understanding
the spirit oi 129 nc, makes Laelius ieign ignorance oi
the names of philosophers and philosophical systems with
which he was thoroughly acquainted, lest he lose popu·
larity by admitting his knowledge of them. Undoubtedly,
the purpose of the men who assembled at Scipio’s house
to read and discuss Greek philosophy and literature was
unknown to the people. ’

ιο. Sources of the Laelius. Cicero made no attempt to
create anything in his philosophical works. He tells us
that the Greek supplied the thought, while the words to
express it never failed him. In this way he enriched the
vocabulary of the Latin language, and made the ripe
thought of the Greeks available ior those who could not
read ior themselves the language oi Plato and Aristotle.
This is an important fact in the history of philosophy.
Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, and others were practically
unknown for centuries, but during all that time their phi-
losophy was active in shaping the world of thought through
the writings of Cicero, which were read almost without
interruption during the Middle Ages.

Itis among the Greeks, then, that we find the sources
