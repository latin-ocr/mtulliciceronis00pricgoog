INTRODUCPION

Α to see her again. Upon the death of his daughter, Cicero

, retired from Rometo devote himself in his country home
to literature. He gave himself so completely to the task
before him that the assassination of Caesar and the stirring
events of the next few months scarcely interrupted his ,
writing. During this period of literary activity he wrote
nearly a score of works chiefly philosophical and ethical,
among them the Cata Maior de Senectute and the Laelius
de Amicitia. Nearly all of these, comprising a large part
of Cicero's writings, have come down to us and well attest
his industry and ability.

The Laelius followed the Cata Maior and both were
written after Caesar's assassination in March of 44 ec,
probably late in the same year. Possibly there are politi-
cal allusions in theLaelins; eg. behind the characters of
Coriolanus and Ti. Gracchus we may detect Antony and
Caesar. One may even go so far as to read into the essay
as a whole the idea that it is written to call the Romans
away from temporary alliances for personal aggrandize-
ment (eg. the triumvirates) to enduring friendships based
on virtus, ie. loyalty to the state and to each other.

3. The Title. The manuscripts vary in giving the title
of this essay; in the best manuscript,*P (Parisinus), the
title is wanting. The editors, too, do not agree. Some
have Laelius de Amicitia αα’ Τ. Pomponium Atticum ,¹
others have Laelius de Amicitia liber ad T. Pomponium
Atticum ,· and still others Laelius de Amicitia. Un-
doubtedly Cicero's favorite title for the book was Laelius,
though he may have added de Amicitia by way of explana-
tion as he did de Senectute in the companion essay, the
Cato Maior. Ch de Off. 2, 31, Sed dc amicitia alio libro
dictum est, qni inscribitur Laelius, and Laelius 5, Sed,
nt in Catane Maiore, qui est scriptus ad te de senectute.
