less of the practical. We must bear in mind, too, that
Cicero wrote froma Roman point oi view, and fora people
whose interests ior the most part were seli-centered; Mon·
taigne, Emerson, and Black, in their discussion of friend-
ship, appeal to us more strongly because their point oi
view is our own, and they emphasize the unselfishness of
true friendship.

Only a few oi the writers on friendship, subsequent to
Cicero, need be mentioned. The arrangement for the most
part is chronological. Plutarch: Moral Essays, including
a chapter on the distinction between a friend and a flat-
terer, and one on the number of our friends. Montaigne:
Essays, Vol. I. Shakespeare: Senneta Milton: Lycidas.
Jeremy Taylor: Measures and Offices os Frr'endslrz'p. rte

in Erfurt), DV( Vr'ndobonenses in Vienna), BSM (Monacen-
ses in Munich), P (Parisinus in Berlin), and H (Harlez'anus
2682 in the library of the British Museum in London).
Editors disagree as to the relative value of these manu-
scripts. Halm, who never saw P and H, considered G the
most reliable; more recent editors are inclined to give P
the highest rank, though they by no means agree with
C. F. W. Miiller in preferring, as he sometimes does, its
readings to the consensus oi the other manuscripts. In
classifying the manuscripts, scholars are agreed that BSV
belong to the same branch, and that G, though a century

or two older, is closely related to them. E and H are also
