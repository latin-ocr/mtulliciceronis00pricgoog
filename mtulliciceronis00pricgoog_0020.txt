INTRODUCHON

In philosophy he was a Stoic, trained first by Diogenes,
and later by Panaetius of Rhodes.
Laelius stands pree'minent as an advocate and exponent

of Greek culture, which was introduced into Rome about ·

150 ae. Efforts had been previously made to introduce
Greek literature and philosophy in Rome, but with only
partial success owing to the prejudice of Romans like
Cato; yet even Cato is said to have yielded to their charm.

Laelius is the chief speaker in the a¹e Amicitia ,· he also
takes a part in Cicero’s de Senectute and a¹e Re Publica.
Laelius is praised by all for his moral integrity, gentleness, '

he attained in 117 ac. As praetor, in 121 13.c.,he was
governor of theprovince of Asia, and upon his return was
prosecuted for extortion (repetendae), but was acquitted.
He had little political ambition, and Cicero speaks of him
as having great influence in the state because of his free-
dom from partisanship. Even as late as 90 ac, though
very old, he was ready to hear his clients at daybreak, and
no one arrived at the Curia before him. In 88 ac. he is
said to have restrained the senate from declaring Marius an
enemy, by affirming that he would never consent to declare
that the man who had saved Rome was an enemy. Cicero
always speaks of Scaevola with great veneration and re·
spect, and introduces him as a speaker in the a'e Oratore
and the de Re Publica. He is to be carefully distinguished
from Q. Mucius Scaevola, pontifex maximus whose “pu-
