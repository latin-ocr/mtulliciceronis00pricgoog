INTRODUCTION

The dialogue is represented as occurring a few days after
the death of Africanus, in 129 nc.
b. The speakers. (a) Laelius. Gaius Laelius, the friend

¹ of Scipio Africanus Minor, and the principal speaker of the

de Amicitia, is to be distinguished from his father, Gaius
Laelius the friend of Scipio Africanus Maior. He was
born about 186 nc, but the date of his death is unknown.
In 151 ΜΤ, while plebeian tribune, he proposed certain
reforms directed toward the improvement of the condition

- of the plebeians and the knights. After his tribunate, he

changed his political affiliations, joined the aristocratic
party, and even went so far as to speak in 130 nc. against
the Papirian law, which would permit the plebeian tribunes
to be ree'lected from year to year. When praetor, in 145 nc,
by his eloquence he brought about the defeat of ameasure
to place the election of the augurs in the hands of the peo‘
ple. In 140 nc. he was elected consul, after having been
defeated for that office the previous year. He was distin-
guished for his augural knowledge, and, according to Cic-
ero, doniis augur and Laelius were synonymous.

Though Laelius proved his courage under Scipio in the
overthrow of Carthage‚ and as praetor conducted a success·
ful campaign against Viriathus in Spain, it was as a states-
man and philosopher that he gained most renown. His
oratory was unimpassioned, and better adapted to court
pleading than to addressing the people. It even caused
him to give way to more eloquent speakers, when enthusi-
asm and acrimony seemed to be needed. His diction was
elegant. There is a tradition that the purist Terence
received much of his polish from his conversations with
Scipio and Laelius, and that Laelius revised certain of his
plays, The studied style of portions of the de Amicitia
may give evidence of Cicero’s effort to reproduce the lan·

guage of Laelius as wellas his sentiments.
