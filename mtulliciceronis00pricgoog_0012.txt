· PREFACE

Tms edition is intended to enable the student to under-
stand and interpret the Laelius. Enough elementary

matter has been introduced to adapt it for use in the best
, preparatory schools‚ and enough advanced matter for the

first year of college. There are repetitions of statement
and numerous cross-references, in which the teacher of
experience will recognize the wellestablished pedagogical
principle that facts are not impressed by being stated but
once.

The notes are full, -especially on the subjects in which
students are generally deficient. There has been a con-
stant effort on the part of the editor to train the student
to observe for himself certain peculiarities in the language
which are characteristic not only of the Laelius but of all
classical Latin.

Acknowledgment is made in the notes of the material
taken from other commentaries Those of Reid, Strelitz,
and Monet were most frequently consulted.

Iwish to acknowledge the valuable criticism and sug-
gestions of Professor J. O. Notestein of the University of
